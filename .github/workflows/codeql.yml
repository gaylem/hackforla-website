              ### Overview
              We need to resolve the new \`[ALERT ${alertId}]\` and either recommend dismissal of the alert or update the code files to resolve the alert.    

              ### Action Items
              - [ ] The following action item serves to "link" this issue as the "tracking issue" for the CodeQL alert and to provide more details regarding the alert. 
              - [ ] ${locationPath}
              - [ ] In a comment in this issue, add your analysis and recommendations.  The recommendation can be one of the following: \`dismiss as test\`, \`dismiss as false positive\`, \`dismiss as won't fix\`, or \`update code\`.  An example of a \`false positive\` is a report of a JavaScript syntax error that is caused by markdown or liquid symbols such as \`---\` or \`{%\`  
              - [ ] If the recommendation is to dismiss the alert, apply the label \`ready for dev lead\` then move the issue to \`Questions/In Review\`
              - [ ] If the recommendation is to update code:
                - [ ] create an issue branch and proceed with the code update
                - [ ] test using docker to ensure that there are no changes to any"

              # Extract the issue number from the response
              issueNumber=$(echo $response | jq -r '.number')
